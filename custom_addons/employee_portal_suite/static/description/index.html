        <h2 class="oe_slogan">Employee Requests Workflow</h2>
        <p class="oe_mt16">
            Employees can submit a wide range of internal requests such as leave, salary advance, training,
            medical reimbursement, asset requests, letters, transfers, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each request follows a structured approval flow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Employee → Direct Manager</li>
            <li>HR Approval</li>
            <li>Finance Approval</li>
            <li>CEO Approval</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Requests are automatically numbered, tracked, and fully logged with approval dates and comments.

        <h2 class="oe_slogan">Material Requests Management</h2>
        <p class="oe_mt16">
            Material Requests allow employees to request materials for projects or worksites with full approval control.
            Each request includes worksite, delivery date validation, materials list, and accounting information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approval stages are fully configurable and follow this flow:

            <li>Purchase Representative</li>
            <li>Store Manager (Project-based)</li>

            Every request includes a detailed approval timeline visible in both the backend and the portal.
            Users can see exactly who approved each stage, when it was approved, and any comments added.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rejections clearly show the rejection stage and reason, ensuring transparency and reducing follow-ups.

            from the request.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system automatically links Purchase Orders to the originating Material Request, displays PO numbers,
            and shows the current PO status (RFQ, Sent, Approved, Received, etc.).

            Approvals are permission-based and respect project-specific roles such as Store Manager
            and Project Manager.
